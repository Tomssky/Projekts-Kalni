<h2>
    We are Noodle Exchange Materials.
</h2>
<h3>
    A proud company that rose from heritage and tradition.
    <br>
    The company started decades ago in Japan as a food service industry.
    Some time later, it moved to the west, delivering Japanese cuisine to America.
</h3>
<!--rebrand text-->
<h2>
    The rebranding.
</h2>
<h3>
    With restaurants bankrupting and being bought all around the town by the government.
    Noodle Exchange wasn't an exception.
    Soon We had to close our doors for good, but we weren't ready to throw in the towel just yet.
    <br>
    We adapted.
    We rebranded.
    We innovated.
    <br>
    And so Noodle Exchange Materials was born.
